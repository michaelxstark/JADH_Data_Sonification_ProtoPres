# Sonifying the pandemic - innovative approaches towards data interaction and engagement formats for scientific, educational and artistic purposes 

### This paper introduces an innovative digital sonification prototype based on openly available COVID-19 data for Austria, Europe. Sinusoidal waves, corresponding to the nine counties of Austria (Vienna, Burgenland, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Tyrol, Styria, Vorarlberg) are set up; the amplitude of the sound generators is modulated by the daily cases of COVID-19-infections, and changes in pitch are achieved by mapping the 7-day-incidence according to the warning system established by the Austrian government. Besides scientific, artistic or informational purposes, the prototype can serve as a valuable, innovative and interactive educational tool.
