      <p class="text">This paper introduces an innovative digital sonification prototype based on openly available COVID-19 data for Austria, Europe. Nine sinusoids that correspond to the nine counties of Austria (Vienna, Burgenland, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Tyrol, Styria, Vorarlberg) are set up, the amplitude of the sound generators is modulated by the daily cases of COVID-19-infections, and pitch changes are achieved by mapping the 7-day-incidence according to the warning system established by the Austrian government. One of the aims of the prototype will be its use as a valuable, innovative and interactive educational device, besides scientific, artistic or informational purposes.</p>
